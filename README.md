Sort of a dump of all the code for the actual data gathering/scraping for our Rowan Uni Software Engineering Chatbot Project (ProfBot!)

This included Pdf-Scraping, Web-Scraping, manually downloading files from Rowan Uni. Sources and then parsing those files.

The main end goal of all of this was to create sqlite databases that can be used by the actual application. Hence this code is no longer needed to be actively run for the web-app and only here for documentation/project-completion purposes.
