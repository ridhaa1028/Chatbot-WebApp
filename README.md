Sort of a dump of all the code for the actual data gathering/scraping for our Rowan Uni Software Engineering Chatbot Project (ProfBot!)
This included Pdf-Scraping, Web-Scraping, manually downloading files from Rowan Uni. Sources and then parsing those files.

The main end goal of all of this was to create databases that can be used by the actual Chatbot, hence this code is no longer needed and only here for documentation purposes.
