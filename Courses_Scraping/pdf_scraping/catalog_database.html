      <td>Internet of Things (IoT), a network that connects "smart" devices with sensing and processing capabilities to other similar devices and to humans, is growing rapidly and controls many aspects of our daily lives. Today, IoT devices can be found not only in a broad spectrum of daily use applications such as home automation and security, home appliances, and automotive industry, but also in critical infrastructure such as power and energy systems, healthcare and medical devices, as well as military systems. As the use of IoT devices grow rapidly, so does the vulnerability of the systems that rely on them against malicious attacks. This course will cover many aspects of IoT with a focus on security hardening primarily with respect to IoT hardware, as well as software function and operation. This course will provide a deeper understanding of the engineering behind IoT embedded systems and insight into security hardening of IoT hardware as it relates to IoT architectures, firmware, and application software. The course will discuss asset management and top security challenges, including but not limited to the lack of compliance within various IoT original equipment manufacturers, the lack of user knowledge and awareness and the consequential lack of update management and challenges of hardening assets. The course will also discuss the vulnerability of IoT architectures to various attacker types, attack vectors, and rogue IoT devices, as well as known and potential defensive mechanisms to mitigate that vulnerability.</td>

      <td>An increasing number of software applications are no longer installed in the end-user's machine. Rather these software applications reside in - and accessed from - the cloud, a term loosely represents the internet, but more specifically refers to the software developer's servers. Such an arrangement relieves the end user from the need to invest in expensive hardware that is possibly under or over specified for the application needed. However, using the cloud comes at a different cost: concern over speed, access and - most importantly - security. This course will provide the essential background needed to understand cloud hardware infrastructure, with a focus on architectures needed to protect and secure critical information technology (IT), operational technology (OT), and other high value technology assets, whether on-premise or in the cloud. The course will also discuss securing data and mission-critical applications in the cloud using secure architectures, from building respective architectures for each impact level (IL) and on obtaining approvals within respective industry compliance regulations.</td>

(p. 25) Thus, human societies on different continents developed food production, writing, animal domestication, immunity to certain infectious diseases, and various technologies at different times (if they developed them at all), largely as a consequence of geography and the distribution of plants and animals (biogeography).

Finally, the civil rights and protest songs of the 60s and 70s will provide a backdrop for exploring issues of race and social culture.</td>

Yet, while this phenomenon transcends time and place, and is inclusive of all communities and their members, reponses to, and representations of suffering may, and have, differed greatly. This class is intended to prompt reflection upon the diversity of questions and answers provoked by suffering in various socio-historical contexts, as preserved in contemporary accounts, religious and philosophical writings, literature, drama, the visual arts, and music. A detailed examination of these documents, texts, and performances hopefully will move students from intial, personal understanding of this complex topic, towards group empathy and cultural sensitivity, as well as fostering appreciation and respect for the many, and profound ways in which individuals and societies have wrestled with tragedy.</td>

Through applications to analysis of functions, optimizations and problems in sciences, a student can appreciate the importance of the derivative. The concept of a definite integral as a limit of approximating sums emerges naturally in the context of problems of areas. Hidden links between the two concepts are formulated in the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, which also provide a convenient shortcut for computing definite integrals.

      <td>Internet of Things (IoT), a network that connects "smart" devices with sensing and processing capabilities to other similar devices and to humans, is growing rapidly and controls many aspects of our daily lives. Today, IoT devices can be found not only in a broad spectrum of daily use applications such as home automation and security, home appliances, and automotive industry, but also in critical infrastructure such as power and energy systems, healthcare and medical devices, as well as military systems. As the use of IoT devices grow rapidly, so does the vulnerability of the systems that rely on them against malicious attacks. This course will cover many aspects of IoT with a focus on security hardening primarily with respect to IoT hardware, as well as software function and operation. This course will provide a deeper understanding of the engineering behind IoT embedded systems and insight into security hardening of IoT hardware as it relates to IoT architectures, firmware, and application software. The course will discuss asset management and top security challenges, including but not limited to the lack of compliance within various IoT original equipment manufacturers, the lack of user knowledge and awareness and the consequential lack of update management and challenges of hardening assets. The course will also discuss the vulnerability of IoT architectures to various attacker types, attack vectors, and rogue IoT devices, as well as known and potential defensive mechanisms to mitigate that vulnerability.

Several real-world scenarios will be discussed and simulated, including preparing academic courses and corporate training packages, assessing audience background and setting appropriate technical rigor and level, building classroom / meeting room / presentation room management skills, conflict avoidance and resolution in such settings; effective strategies for delivering technical content at meetings and conferences, and answering audience questions that may be adversarial in nature. The course will provide readings, discussions, assignments, and most importantly ample opportunities for practice teaching, including a semester-long apprenticeship with Engineering faculty, allowing the student to experience all aspects of teaching and classroom management. The course will also feature guest speakers from industry and government agencies providing unique perspectives for effective teaching and presentation at such settings.</td>

Through applications to analysis of functions, optimizations and problems in sciences, a student can appreciate the importance of the derivative. The concept of a definite integral as a limit of approximating sums emerges naturally in the context of problems of areas. Hidden links between the two concepts are formulated in the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, which also provide a convenient shortcut for computing definite integrals.

The purpose and method of this class will be to encourage experimentation as students work to answer these questions. Student may advance their ideas for the MA in Writing project for Seminar I and II or create a new project. Students will explore theories of creativity, bricolage, process, genre, leitmotif, pattern recognition, and narrative design, using the familiar elements of craft (setting, character, narration, etc.) with emphasis upon advanced strategies represented by model texts.</td>

      <td>Prerequisites: WA 07290 or CRWR 07290</td>
      <td>This class will provide a forum for students to explore the strategies poets use in creative expression. The students will develop an analytical vocabulary that allows them to read, interpret, and evaluate the work of other poets. A major portion of the class will be given over to workshop sessions, where students can share and evaluate each other's work. Students will also become familiar with a body of published poetry that illustrates techniques of expression such as imagery, metaphor, voice, tone, the music and strategy of the line, and other elements of poetry.</td>
