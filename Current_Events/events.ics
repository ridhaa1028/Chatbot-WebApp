  week to week\, you’ll find variety in the movements while strengthening 
 each muscle group. With a focus on form\, instructors will cue movements 
 that you can use inside and outside of class.\nUse the Campus Rec app or

DESCRIPTION:Pilates Fusion is the best of both worlds - pilates core stren
 gthening with elements of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). Bringi
 ng together the world of “mind-body” exercises with “high intensity” musc
 le endurance exercises. Your instructor will program traditional pilates 
 exercises paired with a higher intensity move to find a sweet balance of 
 functional core work and a cardiovascular push. With the workout changing
  week to week\, you’ll find variety in the movements while strengthening 
 each muscle group. With a focus on form\, instructors will cue movements 
 that you can use inside and outside of class.\nUse the Campus Rec app or 
 campusrec.rowan.edu to register for class! You may pre-register for a cla
 ss 3 days in advance. Although walk-ups are welcome\, we strongly recomme
 nd you pre-register to attend a class to secure your spot.\n\nHosted by:
