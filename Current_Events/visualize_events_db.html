Great music, motivating instructors, and a team environment will get you through every workout. You will use a variety of weighted barbells through different music tracks, each dedicated to a different muscle group. Instructions will guide you in movements, weight selections, and tempo. This is a strength training class but moves at a quicker pace, so you should expect both strength and cardiovascular efforts.  You will always make your own weight selection and decide if and when to challenge yourself.  Use the Campus Rec app or campusrec.rowan.edu to register for class! You may pre-register for a class 7 days in advance.

Join us for a 60-minute, accessible yoga practice where we use the tools of yoga to explore balance and mobility both with a chair and on a mat within the same class. Through the practice, we'll learn variations of traditional standing and seated yoga shapes that you can take with you off the mat into everyday life. The practice is a full Yoga experience including warm up, relaxation, making shapes, pranayama (breathing practices), and meditation.  Chair, mat, blocks, and strap are provided--just bring yourself (and perhaps a cozy blanket/towel)!  F.A.Q.:  Am I flexible enough for yoga? You are exactly flexible enough for this practice (no matter your current degree). Am I ______ enough for yoga? You also have just the right size, experience, age, and shape for this practice. This practice is one of self-discovery and renewal. So long as you bring your curiosity and compassion, you are ready. Use the Campus Rec app or campusrec.rowan.edu to register for class! You may pre-register for a class 3 days in advance. Although walk-ups are welcome, we strongly recommend you pre-register to attend a class to secure your spot.</td>

You are exactly flexible enough for this practice (no matter your current degree). Am I ______ enough for yoga? You also have just the right size, experience, age, and shape for this practice. This practice is one of self-discovery and renewal. So long as you bring your curiosity and compassion, you are ready. Use the Campus Rec app or campusrec.rowan.edu to register for class!

      <td>Beginner Aikido</td>
      <td>Participation in Aikido can help to increase your ability to focus and stay calm under pressure along with developing strategies for conflict resolution. Participants will learn effective protection techniques of the traditional Japanese martial art, Aikido, as taught at Agatsu Dojos.  Students can expect to acquire skills in defense through redirection of force without aggression or competition. Specifically, foundational movement and timing principles will lead to techniques that engage throws, locks and pins. Students can expect to also learn ukemi, or the art of receiving techniques, which includes back falls. Exposure to handling of the Jo (wooden staff) and Ken (wooden sword) are also incorporated at this level. No previous experience needed! Use the Campus Rec app or campusrec.rowan.edu to register for class! You may pre-register for a class 3 days in advance. Although walk-ups are welcome, we strongly recommend you pre-register to attend a class to secure your spot.</td>

Join us for a 60-minute, accessible yoga practice where we use the tools of yoga to explore balance and mobility both with a chair and on a mat within the same class. Through the practice, we'll learn variations of traditional standing and seated yoga shapes that you can take with you off the mat into everyday life. The practice is a full Yoga experience including warm up, relaxation, making shapes, pranayama (breathing practices), and meditation.  Chair, mat, blocks, and strap are provided--just bring yourself (and perhaps a cozy blanket/towel)!  F.A.Q.:  Am I flexible enough for yoga? You are exactly flexible enough for this practice (no matter your current degree). Am I ______ enough for yoga? You also have just the right size, experience, age, and shape for this practice. This practice is one of self-discovery and renewal. So long as you bring your curiosity and compassion, you are ready. Use the Campus Rec app or campusrec.rowan.edu to register for class! You may pre-register for a class 3 days in advance. Although walk-ups are welcome, we strongly recommend you pre-register to attend a class to secure your spot.</td>

      <td>Join one of our indoor cycling classes to get moving and find motivation with your fellow Profs!  Cycling allows you to train your aerobic and anaerobic fitness level in an energetic, group setting. Class focus can combine any variety of endurance, strength, intervals, high intensity and recovery. Instructors will use uplifting music and imagery to guide you through each class. Instructors will take you through hills, sprints, jogs, etc., by cueing speeds, gear, and power. You will alway decide if and when to challenge yourself throughout each ride. Use the Campus Rec app or campusrec.rowan.edu to register for class! You may pre-register for a class 7 days in advance. Although walk-ups are welcome, we strongly recommend you pre-register to attend a class to secure your spot.</td>

      <td>International Thanksgiving Feast</td>
      <td>The International Club is excited to announce our upcoming event, an "Around-the-World Thanksgiving" celebration. This event will be a unique opportunity to experience different cultures and traditions while enjoying traditional Thanksgiving foods. We will have a wide variety of foods from around the world, including traditional Thanksgiving dishes. You'll get to taste different flavors, learn about different cultures, and bond with other club members over a shared appreciation for diversity. We will also be looking back at the semester together, sharing our experiences and memories, and discussing our plans for the future. Additionally, we'll have a fun activity where you can get a fake passport and walk around the room to get it stamped by different countries. This is a great way to learn about different cultures and get to know other club members. Finally, we will hear from graduating students about their experiences and insights, and we will have an open discussion about our future plans as a club. Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity to celebrate diversity, enjoy great food, and bond with your fellow club members. We look forward to seeing you all there!</td>
